###Node Architecture######

Node runtime has several dependencies.
The most important ones are the V8 JavaScript engine 
and libuv.
Node is a runtime built on top of the googles V8 engine.
If it wasn't for V8 node would have no way of understanding JavaScript code.
V8 is a fundamental part of the node's arhitecture.
V8 engine converts JavaScript code into machine code the computer can understand.
But that alıne is not enough to create a server side rendering framework like node.
Thats why we have the libuv. 

The libuv is a open source library with a stong focus on asynchronous i/o.
This layer is what gives node the access to the underlaying computer operating system,
file system, networking, and more.
Besides that libuv also implements two extremaely important features of node.js.
Whic are the event loop and the thread pool.
In simple terms the event loop is responsible for handling simply tasks like
executing callbacks and network i/o, 
while the thread pool is for more heavy work like file access or compression.
Libuv is completely written in C++
V8 engine is written in JavaScript and C++
Node.js ties all the libraries together no matter if they are written in C++ or JavaScript.
And gives the develpers access to their functions in pure JavaScript.
It provides a nice layer of abstraction in order to make our lives easier.
For example file system features of the node.jscomes from the libuv
instead of messing with C++ to write and read files we use JavaScript.

Node.js also relies on http-parser for parsing http
c-ares for DNS request stuff
OpenSSL for cryptography
zlib for compression


########PROCESSES, THREADS, AND THE THREAD POOL

When we use nodejs on a computer it means that there is a
node process running on that computer.
A process is just a program in execution (Instance of a program in execution on a computer)

#####################IMPORTANT##################
Instance of a program in execution on a computer
In the context of POSIX-oriented operating systems, the term "(program) instance" typically refers to any executing process instantiated from that program (via system calls, e.g. fork() and exec()); that is, each executing process in the OS is an instance of some program which it has been instantiated from.[2]
#####################IMPORTANT##################


Node.js runs in a single thread (thread is a sequence of instrucitons)
Because node.js run on a single thread it makes it easy to block node applications. 
You need be very careful about not blocking that thread.
### WHEN A PROGRAM IS INITIALIZED ###
All the top-level code is executed.
All the modules the app needs are required.
All the callbacks are registered.
After all of this the event loop finally starts running.
Event loop is where most of the work is done.
It is the heart of the node.js architecture.
But some task are too expensive to be executed in the event loop
because they would block the single thread.
Thats were the thread pool comes in. 
Just like the event loop it is provided to the node.js by the
libuv library.
Thread pool gives us 4 additional threads (we can configure it up to 128 threads)
that are completely seperate from the main single thread.
The event loop can automaticly offload heaavy tasks to the thread pool.
All this happens automaticly behind the scenes, it is not us developers who
decide what goes into the thread pool and what doesn't.
Expensive tasks are operations dealing with: files, cryptography,
compression, DNS lookups


############## EVENT LOOP #######################

Event loop is the heart of the node application.
All code except top level code is run using the event loop.
Some parts of the code might be offloaded to the thread pool
but it is the event loop who does the offloading.
Node.js is built around callback functions, functions that are called
as soon as some work is finished.
It works this way becasue node uses an event driven architecture.
#########################
Event driven architecture:
-Events are emitted
-Event loop picks them up
-Callbacks are called
#########################
Things like our application recieving http requests, timers expiring
or a file finising to read emit events as soon as they are done with their work.
The event loop will pick up these events and call the callback functions that are
associated with each event.
Event loop recieves events each time something important happens, and calls the necessary callbacks.
In summary event loop does the orchestration which means it recieves events,
calls their callback functions, and offloads the mnore expensive tasks tothe thread pool.

##### THE ORDER CALLBACK ARE EXECUTED ########
Event loop has multiple phases and each phase has its own seperate callback queue.
We will take a look into the 4 most important phases
There are one or two other phases used internally by the nodejs
but these are not that important for us(at least yet).

1. First phase takes care of the callbacks of expired timers.
If there are callback functions from timers that just expired
these are the first ones to be proccess by the event loop.
If a timer expires later, during the time when one of the other
phases are being proccessed then the callback of that timer will only
be called as soon as the the event loop comes back to this first phase.
Event loop works the same for other callback queues as well.
If a callback queues event is emitted but the event loop is in a later phase
then that callback must wait for the event loop to come back.

2.I/O Polling and Execution of I/OP Callbacks
Polling means looking for I/O events that are ready to be proccessed
and putting them into the callback queue.
In the context of a node application I/O mainly means
networking and file access.
So most of our code is executed in this phase because in a typical node app
bulk of what we need to do is related to networking and file accessing.

3. setImmediate Callbacks
setImmediate is a special type of timer that we can use to process callbacks immediately
after the I/O pollin and execution phase, which can be important in some advanced use cases.

4. Close Callbacks
In this phase all close events are proccessed.
For example when a web server or a seb socket shuts down.

Besides these 4 queues there are 2 more queues
These are:
-Next tick queue
-Other microtasks queue
If there are any callbacks in one of these two queues to be proccessed
They will be executed right after the CURRENT PHASE of the event loop finishes
instead of waiting fot the entire loop tp finish.
So in other wors after each of these 4 phases if there are any callbacks
in these 2 special queues they will be executed right away.

Other microtasks queue is mainly for promises.

We can use the next tick queue when we really really need to execute a certain callback
right after the current event loop phase.
The difference between next tick and setImmediate is, setImmediate only runs after the I/O polling phase
Both the setImmediate and nex tick are for advanced use cases.

#One tick is one cylce of the loop

After we finish a tick nodejs looks if there are any timers or I/O tasks
If there are none than it exits the application.
If there are any timers or I/O tasks it will go to the next tick.
We saw this before, when we didn't had a server node app closed after the tasks were done.
But with the addition of the http server node kept running
because the server kept listening for events.
Also when we are reading or writing files in the background that is also an I/O task
it makes sense that the app doesn't quit while working on the file.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Keep these in mind to not block the event loop


1. Don't use the sync verisons of functions in the
fs, crypto, and zlib modules in your callback funtions.
You can use them on the top level code
because top level code is executed before the vent loop even starts.

2. Don't perform complex calculations (e.x. loops inside loops)

3. Be careful with large JSON objects
At some point it can start to take a long time to parse or stringify JSON.

4. Don't use complex regular expressions.(e.x. nested quantifiers.)
They can take longer than expected.

There are solutions to these problems like
manually uploading to the thread pool, child processes, workers
