_ is reserved for previous value, using _ we can do this:
5+5 would give 10 as as result
_+10 would give 20 as a result

With REPL we can write JavaScript code and execute it in the terminal

To exit the REPL we can use .exit command or use CTRL+D

To clear the console use CTRL + L

We can also write any global variable and add a dot at the end(e.x. String.)
and press TAB twice to get all the methods and properties available to us
