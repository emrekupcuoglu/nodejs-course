// Listening to incoming request from the client.
// listen accepts a couple of parameters first one is the port
// The port we usually use in node is 8000
// But you will see other numbers such as 3000
// A port is a sub-address on a certain host
// Second parameter is the host
// If we don't specify the host it will default
// to the local host. Local host is the current computer
// "127.0.0.1" ia the local host's ip address
// as on optional argument we can specify a callback function
// which will be run as soon as the server starts listening.

// Summary: We created a server and passed in a callback
// that is executed each time a request hits the server.
// Than we started listening for incoming requests on local host port 8000
// Once we had all this running we did the request by hitting the url
// Than under the hood of node.js and event was fired
// and that event caused the callback function to be executed
// And as a result of that callback function we got the
// "Hello from the server" response

// Routing
// Routing basically means implementing different actions for different urls
// Routing can became very complicated in a big real world application
// In a real world application we use a tool like Express.js.
// We are going to do that in the next big project
// We will use Express.js to do all of that in that project
// But as we are starting to learn node we will learn
// how to do everything from scratch without any dependencies

// First step to routing is to analyze the url
// We use a built in node module for that which is called url

// API
// In the context of web API's an API is a service from which
// we can request some data
