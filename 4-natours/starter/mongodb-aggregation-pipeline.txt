The aggregation Pipeline doesn't cast types so if doesn't enforce the schema
If it did enforce the schema we could have added fields that didn't specified in our schema
The aggregation pipeline returns a plain JavaScript Object not a mongoose document
This means that it bypass the mongoose.
And because it bypasses the mongoose we lose quite a bit of important features
like enforcing the schema or type casting
If you want the fields you have set ot be a certain type e.g. input fields needs be a string
Then you either need to let the schema do that and not use aggregation pipeline
Or do the type casting manually which is not desirable
So only use aggregation when needed otherwise use queries

MongoDB aggregation pipeline is an extremely powerful and extremely useful mongoDb framework for data aggregation

Ideal is that we basically define a pipeline that all the documents
from a certain collection go through where they are precessed step
by step in order to transform them into aggregated results. 
For example we can use the aggregation pipeline to calculate averages, min and max values,
we can calculate distances even and we can do all kinds of stuff it is so powerful.
