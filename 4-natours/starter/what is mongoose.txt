Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library
for mongoDB and Node.js, a higher level of abstraction.
It is a bit like Express.js
Express.js is an abstraction over Node.js
Mongoose is an abstraction over mongoDB driver
An ODM library is a way for us to write JavaScript
that will then interact with a database.
We could use a regular mongoDB driver to access our database
and it would work just fine.
But instead we use mongoose because it gives us a lot more
functionality out of the box, allowing for simpler and
faster development.
Some of the features mongoose gives us are:
Schemas to model data and relationships, easy data validation,
simple query API, middleware, etc.

Mongoose Schema: where we model our data, by describing the structure of our data,
set default values, and validation.

Mongoose Model: We take the schema and make a model out of it.
Model is a wrapper for the schema, providing an interface to the database for CRUD operations

Mongoose is all about models
Model is like a blueprint we use to make documents.
So they are a bit like classes.
We create a model in mongoose in order to create documents using the model
and to use CRUD operations.

To create a model we use a schema
We use schema to describe our data, to set default values,
to validate the data, etc.


If using skip() with sort(), be sure to include at least one field in your sort that contains unique values, before passing results to skip()
