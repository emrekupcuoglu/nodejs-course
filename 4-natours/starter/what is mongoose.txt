MOngoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library
for mongoDB and Node.js, a higher level of abstraction.
It is a bit like Express.js
Express.js is an abstraction over Node.js
Mongoose is an abstraction over mongoDB driver
An ODM library is a way for us to write JavaScript
that will then interact with a database.
We could use a regular mongoDB driver to access our database
and it would work just fine.
But instead we use mongoose because it gives us a lot more
functionality oout of the box, aloowing for simpler and
faster development.
Some of the features mongoose gives us are:
Schemas to model data and releationships, easy data validation,
simple query API, middleware, etc.

Mongoose Schema: where we model our data, by describing the structure of our data,
set default values, and validation.

Mongoose Model: We take the schema and make a model out of it.
Model is a wrapper for the schema, providing an interface to the database for CRUD operations
