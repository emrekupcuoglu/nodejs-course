node.js or express.js apps can run in different environments.
The most important ones are the development environment
and the production environment.
Depending on the environment we might use different databases, we might
turn logging on or off, we might turn debugging on or off and all kinds
of different settings that might change depending on the environment we are in.

By default express.js sets the environment to development.
If we want to set an environment variable we need to prepend it before the nodemon server.js command
NODE_ENV=development nodemon server.js
Many packages on npm that we use for express development depend on this variable
We should to change this variable to production when we are going to deploy it.

We can do a lot more wtih environment variables.
We usually use environment variables like configuration settings for our application
Whenever our app needs configuration for stuff that might change
based on the environment that it is running we use environmetn variables.
For example we might use different databases for development and testing
so we can define a variable for each and activate the right database according to the environment.
Also we could set sensitive data like passwords and usernames using environment variables.

It is not really practical to define all thses variables in the command where we start the application.
Instead we create a configuration file called config.env in this case
