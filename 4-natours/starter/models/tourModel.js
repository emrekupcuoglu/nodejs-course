// !If we try to put data that is not in the schema like difficulty in for example
// !It will not be inside the document because we didn't specify it in the schema

// ?VIRTUAL PROPERTIES
// !By default, Mongoose does not include virtuals when you convert a document to JSON.
// !For example, if you pass a document to Express' res.json() function, virtuals will not be included by default.
// !To include virtuals in res.json(), you need to set the toJSON schema option to { virtuals: true }.

// !By default, Mongoose does not include virtuals in console.log() output.
// !To include virtuals in console.log(), you need to set the toObject schema option to { virtuals: true }, or use toObject() before printing the object.

// !When we set the toJSON: { virtuals: true }, toObject: { virtuals: true } we also see an id field in our documents
// !The reason for this the mongoose automatically adds a virtual getter to every schema by default and that virtual getter is the id
// !But the virtual id is type of string while the _id is type of ObjectId

// Virtual properties are fields that we can define in our schema but they are not persisted
// So they will not be saved to the data base in order to save us some space there.
// Most of the time we really want to save our data to the database
// But virtual properties make a lot of sense for fields that can be derived from one other
// e.g conversion from km to mile
// So let's define a virtual property that contains the tour duration in weeks
// We convert the duration we have already to weeks easily

// We define the virtual properties on the schema
// We pass in the name of the virtual property as an argument
// And we need to define the get method
// because this virtual property will be created each time
// we get some data out of the data base
// The get function here is called a getter
// This is not hte same get as the one we use for routing
// that one comes from the express.js and this one comes from mongoose
// and they serve different purposes
// Get takes a function as an argument and it can not be an arrow function
// Because an arrow function have a lexical .this keyword
// but we want the .this keyword to point to the mongoose document
// !We can NOT use this virtual property in a query because they are technically not part of the database
tourSchema.virtual("durationWeeks").get(function () {
  return this.duration / 7;
});

// ?MIDDLEWARE
// Just like Express.js mongoose also has the concept of middleware
// Middleware is an absolutely fundamental concept in mongoose just like in Express js
// We will use middleware throughout this project.
// Just like with Express js we can use mongoose middleware to make something happen between two events
// e.g. for each time a document is saved to the database we can run a function between when the save command is issued
// and the actual saving of the document or after the actual saving.
// Because we can define actions to run before or after a certain event mongoose middleware is divided into two kinds pre hook and post hook
// There are 4 types of middleware in mongoose: Document, query, aggregate, and model middleware

// Just like virtual properties we define a middleware on the schema

// ?DOCUMENT MIDDLEWARE
// Document middleware is a middleware that can act on the currently processed document
// This is the pre middleware this will run before an actual event
// This takes the event as the first argument and a callback function as the second argument
// This runs before the .save() and .create() method but not on .insertMany()
tourSchema.pre("save", function (next) {
  // In a "save" middleware the this keyword will point to the currently processed document.
  // This is the reason it is called Document Middleware
  // it is because in this function we have access to the document that is being processed.
  // *We need to define the slug property in our schema for it to show up
  this.slug = slugify(this.name, { lower: true });
  next();
});

// In the case of a post middleware the callback function has access
// to the document that was just saved to the database as well as the next function.
// *Post middleware functions are executed after all the pre middleware functions are executed.
// eslint-disable-next-line prefer-arrow-callback
tourSchema.post("save", function (doc, next) {
  // console.log("this of post middleware", typeof this, this);
  // console.log("doc of post middleware", typeof doc, doc);
  next();
});

// ?QUERY MIDDLEWARE
// Query middleware allows us to run functions before or after a certain query is executed.
// This middleware is going to run before any find query is executed
// The big difference is that the this keyword will now point at the current query instead of the current document.
// Because we are not processing a document we will process a query.
// Let's say that we can have secret tours in our database
// like for tours that are offered only internally or for a very small VIP group that the public shouldn't know about.
// Since these tours our secret we don't want these tours to ever appear at the result outputs.
// So we are going to create a secret tour field and query only for tours that are not secret.
// !This has a problem we can not query for secret fields with the code base we have right now.
// !So this is more for learning purposes.
tourSchema.pre(/^find/, function (next) {
  // Jonas' way
  // this.find({ secretTour: { $ne: true } });
  // My way
  this.find({ secretTour: { $exists: false } });
  // console.log(this);
  // Checking how long it takes to execute the current query
  this.start = Date.now();
  next();
});

// !RUNNING VALIDATORS ON UPDATE MIDDLEWARE
// With the code below we can run update validators one every update that uses the findOneAndUpdate
// We can also expand it with other pre hooks if we want (e.g. we can add one for update as well)

tourSchema.pre("findOneAndUpdate", function (next) {
  console.log("hello from update");
  this.setOptions({ runValidators: true });
  next();
});

// !If we want to run update validators on multiple schemas not just on tourSchema
// !We can use plugins.
// !Plugins will run for every schema in our project they are awesome!

// function setRunValidators() {
//   this.setOptions({ runValidators: true });
// }
// mongoose.plugin((schema) => {
//   schema.pre("findOneAndUpdate", setRunValidators);
//   schema.pre("updateMany", setRunValidators);
//   schema.pre("updateOne", setRunValidators);
//   schema.pre("update", setRunValidators);
// });

// "find" pre hook doesn't work for findOne so we can see the secretTour using its id
// To make it so the middleware works for the findOne as well we need to specify that as well
// Or instead of repeating ourselves we can use a regular expression that matches any hook that starts with find
// So it will be triggered for find, findOne, findOneAndDelete, etc.
// tourSchema.pre("findOne", function (next) {
//   this.find({ secretTour: { $exists: false } });
//   next();
// });

// *The post middleware has access to the actual docs returned from the database instead of the query like the pre middleware
// This is because post middleware runs after the query has already executed
// therefore it has access to the documents that we returned.
// *This keyword still points to the Query object
tourSchema.post("find", function (docs, next) {
  // Checking how long it takes to execute the current query
  const time = Date.now() - this.start;
  console.log(`The query took ${time} miliseconds to finish`);
  next();
});

// ?AGGREGATE MIDDLEWARE
// Aggregate middleware allows us to run functions before or after an aggregation happens.
// Right now secret tours are still being used in aggregation.
// When we use the getTourStats() method we get 10 tours instead of 9
// Because when we are aggregating data we are still using the secret tours in our statistics
// The this keyword in aggregation middleware points to the Aggregate object
tourSchema.pre("aggregate", function (next) {
  // pipeline method returns <ARRAY> the current pipeline.
  // The current pipeline is similar to the operation that will be executed.
  console.log(this.pipeline());
  // We need to add another match statement to the beginning of the pipeline
  // When we want to add something to the beginning of an array we use the unshift method
  // With this mongoose adds the aggregation operation we want
  // to the beginning of the aggregation pipeline before sending it to the mongoDB server.
  this.pipeline().unshift({ $match: { secretTour: { $exists: false } } });
  next();
});

// ?MODEL
// We create the model like this
// First argument of the mongoose.model() method is the name of the model
// It is a convention to always start with an uppercase pn model names and variables
// Second argument is the schema
// *save() method creates a collection automatically for us
// It takes the name of the model which is "Tour" in this case
// turns it in to lower case and pluralizes it
// mongoose tries to guess the plural form but it can make mistakes
// If we want to manually specify what the name of the collection should be
// We can pass in an additional argument and the value we pass in becomes the name of the collection
// Third argument can be a string or an object
// both of them will work
// const Tour = mongoose.model("Tour", tourSchema,"tours");
// const Tour = mongoose.model("Tour", tourSchema,{collection:"tours"});

const Tour = mongoose.model("Tour", tourSchema);

module.exports = Tour;

// ****This part was for before refactoring for the MVC architecture
// We have created a new document from the model
// testTour is a document

// const testTour = new Tour({
//   name: "The Forest Hiker",
//   rating: 4.7,
//   price: 497,
// });
// The testTour we have created is an instance of the Tour model
// So it has a few methods on it we can use
// in order to interact with the database

// We can use the save method on the document instance to
// save the document to the database
// This will save this to the tours collection in the database
// The save method will return a promise we can then consume.
// For now let's use then() in the future we will use async/await
// In th then() method we have access to the document that was just saved to the database
// So the resolved value of the promise that the save() method returns
// is the final document as it is in the database.

// testTour
//   .save()
//   .then((doc) => {
//     console.log(doc);
//   })

// If anything goes wrong during the saving of the document to the database
// we catch that error.

// .catch((err) => {
//   console.log("ERROR:", err);
// });
