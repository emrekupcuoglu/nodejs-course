Express is a minimal node.js framework, which means it is built on top of node.js
basically a a higler level of abstraction. It is the most popular node.js framework.
Behind the scenes express is written in 100% node.js code.

Express contains a very robust set of features: complex routing,
easier handling of requests and responses, middleware, server-side rendering, etc.
This allows us to write node.js applications so much faster because
we don't have to re-invent the wheel.

Express makes it easier to organize our application into the MVC architecture.
