Express is a minimal node.js framework, which means it is built on top of node.js
basically a a higher level of abstraction. It is the most popular node.js framework.
Behind the scenes express is written in 100% node.js code.

Express contains a very robust set of features: complex routing,
easier handling of requests and responses, middleware, server-side rendering, etc.
This allows us to write node.js applications so much faster because
we don't have to re-invent the wheel.

Express makes it easier to organize our application into the MVC architecture.

In express.js many packages depend on a special variable called NODE_ENV
It is a variable that should define whether we are in development or in production.
However express.js doesn't define this variable and we have to do it manually
The easiest way to do it is from the terminal

The standard for connecting the variables in the .env file with our code
is using the dotenv packages
npm i dotenv to install it
